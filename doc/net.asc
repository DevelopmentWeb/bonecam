= Bonecam network configuration

== Introduction

The network on the bonecam is configured using https://connman.net/[conman]. This means that we can not just edit some configuration files; we must run applications with proper parameters.

The generic steps involved in configuring a network interface are:

. Find the ID of the network interface using get-services
. Set network parameters using set-ipv4-method
. Optionally, set up DNS using set-nameservers

The service is of the form ethernet_405fc276b749_cable

.Set static IP (default)
----
$ cd /usr/lib/connman/test/
$ ./get-services
$ ./set-ipv4-method <service> manual <address> [netmask] [gateway]
----

.Reset to DHCP
----
$ cd /usr/lib/connman/test/
$ ./get-services
$ ./set-ipv4-method <service> dhcp
----

== Notes

. Remember to use the console when switching between DHCP and manual.
. The settings are applied to a specific hardware device. This means that if the SD card is moved to a different Bonecam, the network settings become reset to DHCP.

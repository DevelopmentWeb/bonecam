A few sketchy instructions for building my "bonecam image".

Start by checking out the Ångstrom setup scripts according to the instructions here:
http://www.angstrom-distribution.org/building-angstrom

Perform the config and update from Step 2.
You can now apply my pseudo-patches as follows.

Copy bonecam-image.bb to sources/meta-ti/recipes-misc/images/
Copy gst-plugins-bad_0.10.23.bb to sources/openembedded-core/meta/recipes-multimedia/gstreamer/

You can now try to build the bonecam-image:

MACHINE=beaglebone ./oebb.sh bitbake bonecam-image

I realize these are not the right way to do things; however, until I have time to properly understand Ångstrom and Openembedded they will have to do.
